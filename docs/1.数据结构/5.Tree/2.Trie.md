## 简介

### 相关算法

1. 



### 适用范围

1. **Longest common prefix**

2. **Search suggestions**



### 概念

- is a tree data structure used for storing and locating keys from a set. The keys are usually strings that are stored character by character—each node of a trie corresponds to a single character rather than the entire key.
- sequentially dependent on each other

### 复杂度

| 方法                 | 复杂度 |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| **Insert()**:        | Length |
| **Search():**        | Length |
| **Search prefix():** | Length |

### 现实联系

- **Autocomplete system:** One of the most common applications of trie is the autocomplete system in search engines, such as Google. This is the feature that prompts the search engine to give us some suggestions to complete our query when we start typing something in the search bar. These suggestions are given based on common queries that users have searched already that match the prefix we have typed.
- **Orthographic corrector:** Ever seen pop-up suggestions or red lines under a word while you’re typing a message? That’s an orthographic corrector making suggestions and pointing out spelling mistakes by searching through a dictionary. It uses a trie data structure for efficient searches and retrievals from the available database.

## 方法

```java
private class Node{

    public boolean isWord;
    public Node[] next;

    public Node(boolean isWord){
        this.isWord = isWord;
        next = new Node[26];
    }

    public Node(){
        this(false);
    }
}
```



### Add 

```java
public void add(String word){

    Node cur = root;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < word.length() ; i ++){
        char c = word.charAt(i);
        if(cur.next[c-'a'] == null)
            cur.next[c-'a'] = new Node();
        cur = cur.next[c-'a'];
    }

    if(!cur.isWord){
        cur.isWord = true;
        size ++;
    }
}
```



### Search

```java
public boolean contains(String word){

    Node cur = root;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < word.length() ; i ++){
        char c = word.charAt(i);
        if(cur.next[c-'a'] == null)
            return false;
        cur = cur.next[c-'a'];
    }
    return cur.isWord;
}
```
