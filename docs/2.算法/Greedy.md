# Greedy

[toc]

## 简介

### 概念

- **Greedy** is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece. This means it chooses the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. 
- It makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that it will lead to a globally optimal solution. 

### 适用范围

-  if selecting a series of local optima allows us to construct or identify the globally optimum solution.

### 复杂度



### 现实联系

- **CPU Scheduling algorithms:** Many algorithms which use the greedy approach help in CPU scheduling.
- **LAN Networks:** In a large LAN with many switches, finding a minimum spanning tree is important to ensure that only a minimum number of packets will be transmitted across the network.
- **Social Networking Websites:** These applications recommend a list of people that a user may know through the Dijkstra algorithm. The algorithm finds the shortest path between users measured through connections among them.
